# collaborative-design-wiki
Home of the [collaborative design wiki](https://github.com/oresmus/collaborative-design-wiki/wiki), for now (which is associated with, but distinct from, the [collaborative design blog](https://oresmus.github.io/)).

To edit that wiki I think you will need a GitHub account (sorry, but don't hesitate to get one for this purpose, it's easy and safe).

To find that wiki, look to the right for a vertical row of icons; one of them in the middle looks like a little open book, and clicking it gets you into the wiki. (Or just click the link above...)

To edit it once you're there, find an "edit" button. Notice the preview tab above the edit field, and remember to use the "save changes" button (bottom right) at the end. If you try to leave the page and the browser warns you about possibly losing changes, it means you forgot to press that.

(FYI I don't yet know if this GitHub wiki has good handling of simultaneous edits by different people on one page.)
